---> add_single_quote:
	- fill the list with inside single quote
	string.
	- convert list to string
	- clear the list since we no longer need it
	also for memory leak
	- check for "'" to see if we reach the end 
		- if line is still full:
			- check if redirection, Pipe, space,
			'\0':
				add_back_type to list
			- else:
				add_back_type to list with b = 1
